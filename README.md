# Ultra-lightweight face detection model
[ultra-lightweight face detection model](https://github.com/Linzaer/Ultra-Light-Fast-Generic-Face-Detector-1MB)
This model is a lightweight facedetection model designed for edge computing devices.
- In terms of model size, the default FP32 precision (.pth) file size is **1.04~1.1MB**, and the inference framework int8 quantization size is about **300KB**.
- In terms of the calculation amount of the model, the input resolution of 320x240 is about **90~109 MFlops**.
- There are two versions of the model, version-slim (network backbone simplification,slightly faster) and version-RFB (with the modified RFB module, higher precision).
- Widerface training pre-training model with different input resolutions of 320x240 and 640x480 is provided to better work in different application scenarios.
- Support for onnx export for ease of migration and inference.
- [Provide NCNN C++ inference code](https://github.com/Linzaer/Ultra-Light-Fast-Generic-Face-Detector-1MB/tree/master/ncnn).
- [Provide MNN C++ inference code](https://github.com/Linzaer/Ultra-Light-Fast-Generic-Face-Detector-1MB/tree/master/MNN), [MNN Python inference code](https://github.com/Linzaer/Ultra-Light-Fast-Generic-Face-Detector-1MB/tree/master/MNN/python), [FP32/INT8 quantized models](https://github.com/Linzaer/Ultra-Light-Fast-Generic-Face-Detector-1MB/tree/master/MNN/model).
- [Provide Caffe model](https://github.com/Linzaer/Ultra-Light-Fast-Generic-Face-Detector-1MB/tree/master/caffe/model) and [onnx2caffe conversion code](https://github.com/Linzaer/Ultra-Light-Fast-Generic-Face-Detector-1MB/tree/master/caffe).
- [Caffe python inference code](https://github.com/Linzaer/Ultra-Light-Fast-Generic-Face-Detector-1MB/blob/master/caffe/ultra_face_caffe_inference.py) and [OpencvDNN inference code](https://github.com/Linzaer/Ultra-Light-Fast-Generic-Face-Detector-1MB/blob/master/caffe/ultra_face_opencvdnn_inference.py).


## Accuracy, speed, model size comparison
The training set is the VOC format data set generated by using the cleaned widerface labels provided by [Retinaface](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/blob/master/RetinaFace/README.md)  in conjunction with the widerface data set (PS: the following test results were obtained by myself, and the results may be partially inconsistent).
### Widerface test
- Test accuracy in the WIDER FACE val set (single-scale input resolution: **320*240 or scaling by the maximum side length of 320**)
